# Homebridge Neakasa — Project Summary

## Project Overview

**homebridge-neakasa** is a Homebridge plugin that brings the Neakasa M1 Cat Litter Box into Apple HomeKit. It was built as a TypeScript/Node.js port of the [Home Assistant Neakasa Integration](https://github.com/timniklas/hass-neakasa) by [@timniklas](https://github.com/timniklas).

- **Repository**: [github.com/smithmarcw/homebridge-neakasa](https://github.com/smithmarcw/homebridge-neakasa)
- **npm package**: `homebridge-neakasa`
- **Current version**: v1.2.0
- **License**: MIT

---

## Goal

Give Neakasa M1 owners full control and monitoring of their smart cat litter box through Apple HomeKit — including switches for cleaning modes, sensors for litter level and waste bin status, and automation triggers for events like a cat entering the box. No Home Assistant required.

## What Was Built

### Core Plugin Architecture
- **Dynamic platform plugin** that auto-discovers Neakasa devices on the account
- **60-second polling** (configurable) keeps HomeKit state in sync with the device
- **Auto-reconnect** on authentication failures — no manual restart needed
- **Homebridge Config UI X** support with a full settings schema for easy configuration

### Authentication System (6-Step Flow)
Ported and debugged the complex Alibaba Cloud IoT authentication chain:

1. **Region detection** — `global.genhigh.com` resolves the user's regional base URL
2. **Login** — email/password auth against the Neakasa cloud (MD5-hashed, spoofed Android app headers)
3. **Region endpoints** — Alibaba IoT API returns the correct regional API gateways
4. **VID acquisition** — OAuth-style device identifier via signed IoT request
5. **SID exchange** — session ID from VID via signed request with custom headers
6. **IoT token** — final credential for all device API calls

All requests to the Alibaba Cloud API Gateway are HMAC-SHA256 signed with proper `x-ca-*` headers, content-MD5, and nonce generation.

### Encryption Layer
- AES-128-CBC encryption/decryption for login tokens
- Dynamic key/IV extraction from login responses
- Token generation with timestamps for API authentication

### HomeKit Services

**6 Core Services (always shown):**
| Service | Type | What It Does |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Litter Level | FilterMaintenance | Sand level as 0-100% with low-level alert |
| Waste Bin Full | OccupancySensor | Alerts when waste bin needs emptying |
| Status | ContactSensor | Reports device state (Idle, Cleaning, Cat Present, etc.) |
| Auto Clean | Switch | Toggle automatic cleaning on/off |
| Clean Now | Switch (stateless) | Trigger immediate cleaning cycle |
| Level Now | Switch (stateless) | Trigger immediate sand leveling |

**7 Optional Switches (off by default, enabled in config):**
- Child Lock, Auto Bury, Auto Level, Silent Mode, Unstoppable Cycle, Auto Recovery, Young Cat Mode

**3 Optional Sensors (off by default):**
- Bin State (LeakSensor — Normal/Full/Missing)
- WiFi Signal (HumiditySensor — RSSI converted to percentage)
- Cat Weight (HumiditySensor per registered cat — one sensor per cat)

## Bugs Found & Fixed

### 1. Wrong IoT Token Endpoint
- **Problem**: Code called `/api/prd/account/getiottoken.json` via `doRequestRaw` on the OAuth API gateway
- **Fix**: Changed to `/account/createSessionByAuthCode` via `doRequest` on the standard API gateway (matching the HA integration)

### 2. Wrong SID Extraction Path
- **Problem**: Code read `response.data.data.sid`
- **Fix**: Corrected to `response.data.data.data.loginSuccessResult.sid`

### 3. Unsigned SID Request (400 Error)
- **Problem**: `getSidByVid` used raw `axios` without Alibaba Cloud's required HMAC-SHA256 signing headers
- **Fix**: Routed through `IoTClient.doRequestRaw()` and added `extraHeaders` support to the client so the `Vid` header could be passed alongside the signing headers

### 4. Missing Signature Headers (403 Error)
- **Problem**: `doRequest` was missing `x-ca-signature-headers` from the signed request
- **Fix**: Added the required header to the signing calculation

### 5. HomeKit Tile Names All Showing "Neakasa M1"
- **Problem**: HomeKit uses `ConfiguredName` (not `Name`) for tile display — all 15 services showed the accessory name
- **Fix**: Added `setServiceName()` helper that sets both `Name` and `ConfiguredName` on every service

### 6. Too Many Tiles in Home App
- **Problem**: 15 tiles cluttered the Home app
- **Fix**: Reduced to 6 core services always shown, made the rest opt-in via config toggles

### 7. DNS Resolution in Docker
- **Problem**: `getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN global.genhigh.com` — Homebridge running in Docker on TrueNAS Scale couldn't resolve DNS
- **Fix**: User added `dns: [8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1]` to their docker-compose configuration

## Release History

### v1.2.0 — Simplified Accessories & Fixed Naming
- Reduced default tiles from 15 to 6 core services
- Fixed HomeKit tile naming with `ConfiguredName` characteristic
- Added Status (ContactSensor) and Litter Level (FilterMaintenance) as core defaults
- Made 7 switches and 3 sensors opt-in via Homebridge UI config
- Updated config.schema.json with organized Optional Switches and Optional Sensors fieldsets

### v1.1.0 — Stable Auth & Feature Expansion
- Fixed entire authentication flow (3 separate bugs)
- Added signed IoT client support with extra headers
- Added configurable sensors: Bin State, WiFi Signal, Cat Weight
- Cleaned up git repo, set up npm publishing
- First GitHub release

### Initial Commit — Working Plugin
- Full TypeScript plugin scaffolding
- Alibaba Cloud IoT API client with HMAC-SHA256 signing
- AES-128-CBC encryption for token handling
- Basic switches and sensors

## Automation Ideas for Users

- **"Cat entered the litter box"** — trigger on the Status ContactSensor opening (bucketStatus changes from Idle)
- **"Bin is full"** — trigger on Waste Bin Full OccupancySensor detecting occupancy
- **"Litter is low"** — trigger on Litter Level FilterMaintenance indicating filter change needed
- **"Silent mode at night"** — enable the Silent Mode switch on a schedule
- **"Notification on cleaning complete"** — trigger when Status ContactSensor returns to Closed (Idle)

---

## Pending / Future Work

- **npm publish**: v1.2.0 is built and ready, needs OTP from authenticator to complete `npm publish --access public`
- **Cat Present sensor**: A dedicated OccupancySensor that triggers only on `bucketStatus === 4` (Cat Present) would give cleaner automation triggers than the general Status ContactSensor
- **README update**: Current README is out of date — doesn't reflect v1.2.0 features, optional config, or correct GitHub URLs
